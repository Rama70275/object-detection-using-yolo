Object Detection Using YOLOv8 ðŸš€

This project demonstrates object detection using the powerful YOLOv8 model (You Only Look Once, version 8).YOLOv8 is one of the most accurate and fastest object detection algorithms available, capable of detecting multiple objects in real-time.

ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

object-detection-using-yolov8.ipynb â€” Jupyter Notebook with complete code for loading YOLOv8, running detections, and visualizing results.

Example images (optional): Used for testing object detection.

ðŸ“Œ Features

Load pre-trained YOLOv8 models.

Perform object detection on images.

Visualize bounding boxes and class labels.

Easy-to-understand and beginner-friendly code.

Modular structure for easy customization.

ðŸš€ Requirements
